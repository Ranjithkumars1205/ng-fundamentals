For Complex logic you end
 up with a lot of logic in your HTML if 
you're using template-based forms
it has more limitation,
thing like cross-field validation are more difficult.
and you can't unit test all your form and validation logic if you use template-based forms.

But for simple forms, template-based forms are great.

Reactive form, also known as a model-driven form.

if you're form will be simple, then go with template-driven form..
if you have more custom validation, go with model-driven form
