Here are some real-time scenarios where useFactory and useExisting providers can be used in Angular applications, along with corresponding code examples:

useFactory provider:
--------------------
Real-time scenario: Integration with a third-party library that requires initialization.

Code example:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { ThirdPartyLibrary } from 'third-party-library';

@Injectable()
export class ThirdPartyService {
  constructor(private thirdParty: ThirdPartyLibrary) {
    // Perform initialization or configuration of the third-party library
    this.thirdParty.init();
    this.thirdParty.configure();
  }

  // ...
}

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    ThirdPartyLibrary,
    {
      provide: ThirdPartyService,
      useFactory: (thirdParty: ThirdPartyLibrary) => {
        return new ThirdPartyService(thirdParty);
      },
      deps: [ThirdPartyLibrary],
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

In this example, we have a ThirdPartyService that depends on a third-party library called ThirdPartyLibrary. The ThirdPartyLibrary is initialized and configured inside the ThirdPartyService constructor. We use the useFactory provider to create an instance of ThirdPartyService and inject the ThirdPartyLibrary using a factory function. The factory function creates and configures the instance of ThirdPartyService with the initialized ThirdPartyLibrary.

Certainly! Let's dive into more real-time scenarios and examples of using useFactory and useExisting providers in Angular applications:

useFactory provider:
--------------------

Real-time scenario: Integration with a payment gateway that requires initialization and configuration.

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { PaymentGateway } from 'payment-gateway-library';

@Injectable()
export class PaymentService {
  constructor(private paymentGateway: PaymentGateway) {}

  makePayment(amount: number) {
    this.paymentGateway.initialize();
    this.paymentGateway.configure({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
    this.paymentGateway.processPayment(amount);
  }
}

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    PaymentService,
    {
      provide: PaymentGateway,
      useFactory: () => {
        return new PaymentGateway();
      },
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

In this example, we have a PaymentService that depends on the PaymentGateway from a third-party library. The PaymentGateway requires initialization and configuration. We use the useFactory provider to create an instance of the PaymentGateway in the factory function.
